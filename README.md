A simple school project, made for graduation as an IT technician

The following project was made by me as part of the course and it contributed to the semester grade
It was also my first time working with mobile Java developing, 
and as a first-time Fullstack programmer, I didn't finished it in time.
I'm utilizing GitHub to keep a record of my changes and progressions through my development.
